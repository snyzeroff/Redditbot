## Documentation

- [Praw](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/installation.html)
- [A Reddit API Documentation](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api)

The script is designed to automate the process of responding to Reddit comments that match specific keywords, using the OpenAI API to generate a response that is published as a reply to the original comment. The script also takes steps to avoid duplicate responses and API request saturation.

The script stores the IDs of comments it has already responded to in a list called "comments_replied_to". This is done to avoid replying to the same comment multiple times.

The comment identifiers are also written to a text file called "comments_replied_to.txt" to save the list between runs of the script.

Finally, the script waits 10 seconds between each iteration of the loop to avoid overloading the Reddit API with requests.


-----
In your command prompt or terminal, navigate to the project directory.

Run the bot.py script by typing python bot.py.

The script will continuously check for new comments in the specified subreddit, and if a comment containing any of the selected keywords is found, the bot will generate a response using the OpenAI API and post it as a reply to the comment.

To stop the script, press CTRL + C in your command prompt or terminal.

### Notes
To avoid replying to the same comment multiple times, the script stores the IDs of the comments it has already replied to in a text file called comments_replied_to.txt in the data directory. If you want to reset the list, simply delete the file.

The script waits for 10 seconds between each loop iteration to prevent the bot from overwhelming the Reddit API with requests.

Make sure to abide by the Reddit API guidelines and not to spam or harass users with the bot.
